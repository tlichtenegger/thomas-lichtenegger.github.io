## About me

I completed my PhD in Theoretical Physics at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz, Austria, followed by a postdoctoral stay at the University at Buffalo, New York, on the topic of quantum liquids such as superfluid helium at absolute zero. Since 2014, I have been working on the multiscale problem of complex multiphase and multiphysics flows as a Senior Scientist at the <a href="https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-stroemungslehre-und-waermeuebertragung/pfm/"> Department of Particulate Flow Modelling </a> at JKU, where I earned my Habilitation (venia docendi) in 2021. In our group, I lead the team for particle-based simulations with a focus on data-driven methods and enjoy supervising PhD students in this area.

During my PhD studies, I learned the importance of first identifying the relevant physics of a problem, then modeling it rigorously, and finally solving it numerically in an efficient fashion. This principle also guides my current research activities, where I integrate physics-based models with data-driven approximations. Compared to classical simulation methods, this kind of approach enables calculations that are several orders of magnitude faster so that real-time simulations of complex flows are within reach.
